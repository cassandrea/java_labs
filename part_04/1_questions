Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
A: an indexed data structure

2) Write the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
A: String cats[] = new String[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?
A: an array of arrays (and so on and so forth)

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
A: int scores[] [] = new int [6] [6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
A: dogs[9]

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
A: an error when you try to use an element outside of the array length

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
A: int x = array[array.length -2]

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
A: it's limited only by the max size for integers

9) What is a bubble sort?
A: a sort method that runs through the items and moves the smallest to the left, then iterates until sorted

10) How does a bubble sort work?
A: see 9

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
A: when the data contained within the arrays will be shorter/longer than the others. bus schedule with fewer times on weekends

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
A: for(x =1; x > example.length; x++) {
    System.out.println(example[x]);
    }

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
A: while (x > example.length) {
    System.out.println(example[x]);
    x++
    }

14) What is a queue?
A: a list of elements that can be accessed on a first-in-first-out basis

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
A: put() and get()

16) What is a stack?
A: a list of elements that can be accessed on a first-in-last-out basis

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
A: the order in which you can access elements

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
A: when you need to cycle through a collection of objects (member of the collection class)

for (int iteratorCount = 0; iteratorCount < array.length; iteratorCount++){
    System.out.println(iteratorCount);
    System.out.println(array[iteratorCount]);
}
for (int actualIntInArray : Array) {
    System.out.println(actualIntInArray);
    }

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
A: a set of classes that implement various data structures, such as lists, vectors, sets, and maps

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
A: iterate through each array
parent array contains children array
iterate through each child array until you've reached the length of the parent array

int[][] example = int [5][5];

for (int i=0; i < example.length; i++) {
    for (int t = 0; t < example[i].length; t++) {
        System.out.println(example[i][t]);
     }
}

21) What is a String?
A: a data type that combines a string of characters into an object, any character within "".

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
A:  boolean equals(str)
    int length()
    char charAt(index)
    int compareTo(str)
    int indexOf(str)
    int lastIndexOf(str)

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
A: they cannot be changed once created

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
A: java nameOfProgram parameterOne parameterTwo
