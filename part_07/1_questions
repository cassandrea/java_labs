1) What is a Java package?
A: groups of related classes

2) What is the CLASSPATH variable all about?
A: it tells Java where to find the class files

3) What does the package structure mirror?
A: the filepath

4 How do packages affect access to Java classes?
A: class files are contained in a directory with the name of the package

5) What is an interface?
A: it's similar to an abstract class in that it provides a structure but cannot be implemented
it declares methods, but does not provide a method body - each class that implements the interface must define the method actions

6) What makes interfaces unique?
A: it can be implemented by any number of classes - classes can implement more than one interface
any method declared in the interface must be defined by the implementing class - you can establish default implementations
to get around this

7) What keyword is used to specify that a class is going to use a separate interface?
A: implements

8) What makes interfaces so useful?
A: you can control what must be included in specific classes and you can reduce duplication of code

9) What was added in JDK 8 that makes interfaces even more useful?
A: default implementations

10) How many interfaces can a single class implement?
A: multiple - as needed
