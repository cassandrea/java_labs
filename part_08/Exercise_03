Using MySQLWorkbench do the following

1) create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"
CREATE SCHEMA `car_dealership` ;

create a new table named "clients" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)
    - dealerID (refers to user in users table who is the car dealer)

2) create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

3) create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

4) populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier


5) Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)
    - select all records from clients
        SELECT *
        FROM clients;
    - select all records from clients where car make = "Toyota"
        SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name, cr.make, cr.model
        FROM users u
        JOIN clients cl ON cl.userID = u.id
        JOIN cars cr ON cl.carID = cr.id
        WHERE cr.make = 'Toyota';

    - use a join to select all makes and models that a dealer has sold
        select cr.make, cr.model, u.first_name, u.last_name
        FROM cars cr
        JOIN clients cl ON cl.carID = cr.id
        JOIN users u ON cl.dealerID = u.id
        Order by u.id;

    - use a left join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car
        select u.first_name, u.last_name, cr.make, cr.model, cr.color
        from users u
        left join clients cl on cl.userID = u.id
        left join cars cr on cl.carID = cr.id
        where cr.color = 'Red';

    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table
        INSERT INTO clients (userID, carID, dealerID)
        VALUES (1,9,11);

        INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name)
        VALUES ('Winda', 'Florencia');

        INSERT INTO cars (make, model, color, year)
        VALUES ('Volkswagen', 'Jetta', 'Blue', 2016);

    - create a new table named "test" with at least two fields
        CREATE TABLE test (
        id INT,
        date DATE);
    - use sql to drop the the "test" table
        DROP TABLE test;
    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table
        UPDATE cars
        SET color = 'Red'
        WHERE id = 3;

6) Using MySQLWorkbench, export the the "clients", "users" and "cars" schema with all objects and data into a
self-contained sql file. - check the exported file into git
